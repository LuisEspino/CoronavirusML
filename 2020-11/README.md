### Covid-19 infection trend in Guatemala

The trend of infections is carried out through two perspectives: one having 30 days of information on infections in Guatemala at the beginning of the pandemic and the trend will be shown at different times.

The first execution was configured to predict infections at 50 days, the official number was 644 infected, although later the Guatemalan Ministry of Health corrected the number of infections by increasing them. So the prediction is approximately correct.

The second execution is made for 200 days, according to official data there were 90,968 infected, which indicates that the prediction is correct.

As of November, Guatemala is reducing the number of infections, so the prediction may vary. However, depending on what is happening in Europe there could be a second wave of infections in December, adjustments would have to be made to the model so that the prediction remains correct.

For the department of Guatemala, it is projected that by the end of November, the curve of confirmed cases will decrease.

In the case of Costa Rica, it had a different behavior since the growth curve of the infected behaved rather in the way of a polynomial of degree 4, that is, it can stabilize and begin a decline.

According to the graph, we can observe that indeed, in the next 50 days, the advance of the infected will begin to decline and this is encouraging for the neighboring country.

### Mortality prediction due to COVID - 19 in the department of Guatemala

As days go by we will be able to determine a more accurate solution, by discovering the determined behavior, for the development corelated to the the excecuted solution. The mortality of this pandemic, which started to spread world-wide since december of 2019, prediction based on a linear regression, indicates that the outcome of whether there is a second wave derived from social relaxation related to the current decrease in social restrictions and curfews which were rendered without effect since the past month of october.

The solution of a development corresponding to the prediction that can determine the behavior that will continue to have as the days go by was executed, the mortality of the pandemic that affects the country and has spread worldwide since December of last year, this based in a linear regression, for which the results of said prediction are committed to whether there is a second wave derived from the social relaxation that is currently being experienced based on the drop in restrictions and curfews that have been without effect since the previous month .

Using linear regression, a projection of deaths was made from the deaths of the first 200 days since the pandemic began.

The data on the deceased persons were downloaded from the portal of the Ministry of Public Health and Social Assistance of Gautemala. These range from March 13 to November 8, 2020.

### Prediction of deaths due to COVID - 19 in Honduras

This prediction was made on the 293rd day and deals with the number of deaths predicted for the 350th day after the COVID-19 in Honduras. According to the graph, it can be seen that on day 350 the mortality figure due to the virus would reach 500,000.
