### Covid-19 infection trend in Guatemala

The trend of infections is carried out through two perspectives: one having 30 days of information on infections in Guatemala at the beginning of the pandemic and the trend will be shown at different times.

The first execution was configured to predict infections at 50 days, the official number was 644 infected, although later the Guatemalan Ministry of Health corrected the number of infections by increasing them. So the prediction is approximately correct.

</p>

The second execution is made for 200 days, according to official data there were 90,968 infected, which indicates that the prediction is correct.

As of November, Guatemala is reducing the number of infections, so the prediction may vary. However, depending on what is happening in Europe there could be a second wave of infections in December, adjustments would have to be made to the model so that the prediction remains correct.

For the department of Guatemala, it is projected that by the end of November, the curve of confirmed cases will decrease.

### Prediction of infecteds in Costa Rica

In the case of Costa Rica, it had a different behavior since the growth curve of the infected behaved rather in the way of a polynomial of degree 4, that is, it can stabilize and begin a decline.

The degree of the polynomial has an R2 of 0.998, that is, the data does fit the model. Also with grade 5 R2 is even closer to 0.999, but the behavior does not correspond to a pandemic, because it goes down too quickly, without stabilizing.

</p>

According to the graph, we can observe that indeed, in the next 50 days, the advance of the infected will continue but could begin to stabilize, which is encouraging for the neighboring country.

With the above it is observed that by day 300, the number of infected will be close to 160,000 people, that is, it will continue to increase.

The data used for the elaboration of the graph was obtained from [COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) In the case of Costa Rica, the first day for the graph is taken on March 5, 2020 with zero infected, and the final data of the graph is for November 8, 2020 with 116,363 infected, for a total of 249 days sample history.

### Mortality prediction due to COVID - 19 in the department of Guatemala
As days go by we will be able to determine a more accurate solution, by discovering the determined behavior, for the development corelated to the the excecuted solution. The mortality of this pandemic, which started to spread world-wide since december of 2019, prediction based on a linear regression, indicates that the outcome of whether there is a second wave derived from social relaxation related to the current decrease in social restrictions and curfews which were rendered without effect since the past month of october.

The solution of a development corresponding to the prediction that can determine the behavior that will continue to have as the days go by was executed, the mortality of the pandemic that affects the country and has spread worldwide since December of last year, this based in a linear regression, for which the results of said prediction are committed to whether there is a second wave derived from the social relaxation that is currently being experienced based on the drop in restrictions and curfews that have been without effect since the previous month .

Using linear regression, a projection of deaths was made from the deaths of the first 200 days since the pandemic began.

The data on the deceased persons were downloaded from the portal of the Ministry of Public Health and Social Assistance of Gautemala. These range from March 13 to November 8, 2020.

The pandemic that we are experiencing today has greatly changed the way people live and although the social fear that it represented has already diminished, it is still a threat to society, especially for those people who are already over 60 years old, have obesity , diabetes, heart disease and so on, that make them more vulnerable, that they should be cared for even more, having more protection measures because in any case they become infected can be a great risk to their life.
The reason why the prediction of deaths in the department of Guatemala is relevant is derived from the fact that with it the death rate can be calculated to which the results that are being expressed in the software are added, in such a way that can predict the amount and speed with which the virus is taking the lives of the most affected people, so that entities such as the government can take action and respond immediately or in advance preferably for any eventuality or change in the behavior currently registered, in such a way that it can spread on a smaller scale as well as control the cases of deaths due to COVID 19 which are presented daily with the respective values ​​that are recorded as there are changes in the information.


### Mortality prediction due to COVID - 19 in Honduras

This prediction was made on the 293rd day and deals with the number of deaths predicted for the 350th day after the COVID-19 in Honduras. According to the graph, it can be seen that on day 350 the mortality figure due to the virus would reach 500,000.

### Number of cases per day of covid 19 in the US for 218 days

The linear correlation graph using the polynomial characteristics shows us the behavior of the cases that have been registered in the US, in the first 218 days and we can clearly see the second wave of infections that the country is going through.

For the analysis of cases in the United States, the following page was taken as a reference, from which the data of the first 218 days were taken. [COVID-19 in the US for 218 days](https://espanol.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/previouscases.html)



## Average deaths from confirmed cases and age of covid19 in Guatemala

Taking into account the number of deaths, the number of confirmed cases by average age taking into account the years from ten to ten starting at zero and ending at one hundred, that is, for the first group of data the average age would be five, for the second fifteen and for the last one it would be ninety-five. We proceeded to the analysis of these data using artificial intelligence where by means of the k-means algorithm of the sklearn library using the following data set.

| Number of deaths | Confirmed cases | Average age |
| ---------------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| 31               | 3045            | 5           |
| 21               | 5790            | 15          |
| 107              | 28883           | 25          |
| 209              | 28398           | 35          |
| 479              | 18996           | 45          |
| 757              | 12701           | 55          |
| 1032             | 7673            | 65          |
| 575              | 2317            | 75          |
| 241              | 827             | 85          |
| 41               | 134             | 95          |

Grouping the data by 2 clusters, the result of the k-means algorithm indicates the following:

### Centroid 1

_where each data refers to the mean of the grouped data_

| Number of deaths | Confirmed cases | Average age |
| ---------------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| 385              | 4641            | 56          |

### Centroide 2

_where each data refers to the mean of the grouped data_

| Number of deaths | Confirmed cases | Average age |
| ---------------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| 265              | 25425           | 35          |

### Graph of the previous data

![Grafica de clusters ](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12839670/99020367-0ea9ee00-2524-11eb-9323-fff1fd87ca90.JPG)

The graph only shows the number of deaths in two dimensions on the "X" axis and the number of confirmed cases on the "Y" axis.

### Analysis of data

From the data shown for centroid 1, it can be said that for every 464 Data analysis1 positive cases with people with an average age of 56 years, 385 will die.

From the data shown for centroid 2, it can be said that for every 25,425 positive cases with people with an average age of 35 years, 265 will die.

What seeing it in a fast way and corobrating what is indicated in a global way, older people are more susceptible to dying, since out of 4641 cases the
8% while of the cases of the youngest people of 25425 cases 1% dies.

With the estimate given above, it is possible to predict the number of deaths that there will be in a hospital, city or any place in general since we can deduce the probability that a person has of dying according to their age and the number of deaths that there will be in a population.

### How to predict

The correct way to find out if a person belongs to one set of data or another is through their age, if their age is closer to 56 years than to 35 years it means that they belong to that set of information, otherwise If your age is closer to 35 years than 56 years, it belongs to the second set of information.
